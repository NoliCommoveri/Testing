# Receipts — a capture-and-export companion for KennelOS

A small, **local-first, offline** web app for a dog-breeding business: snap a photo
of a receipt or log a mileage trip on your phone, let it **pull the details off the
photo** (offline OCR), and **export a CSV you load straight into KennelOS's Expense
ledger**. It shares KennelOS's philosophy — no backend, no build step, all data in
the browser, works offline as an installable PWA.

## What it does

- **📷 Receipts** — capture a photo (camera on mobile) or **upload an existing
  photo/screenshot** from your library or files — either way works as the starting
  point. The image is stored on-device, and offline OCR pre-fills **amount, date, and
  vendor** for you to confirm. Pick a category (the same categories KennelOS uses) and
  whether the cost is kennel-wide overhead or for a specific dog.
- **🚗 Trips** — log mileage (miles × rate). Enter **start/end odometer** and the miles
  compute themselves (or type miles directly), and record the **vehicle** and **driver**
  (each a separately saved list, remembered as you type and prefilled next time). The
  dollar amount is figured the same way KennelOS figures it, so a trip becomes a clean
  deductible-mileage expense. Odometer/vehicle/driver stay in this app for your mileage
  log — the KennelOS export carries only miles × rate.
- **Receipts / Trips toggle** — the main list shows one kind at a time (never mixed),
  newest first. A light **Filter** panel narrows it further by date range (or a quick
  last‑7/30/90‑days pick), business, and — depending on the toggle — category (receipts)
  or vehicle (trips).
- **⬆ Export to KennelOS** — download a CSV of everything (or just what you haven't
  exported yet). Load it in KennelOS under **Import / Export → Import expenses (CSV)**,
  which shows a preview where you can **attach each expense to a dog, litter, pairing,
  or your kennel** before saving. Re-importing the same file **updates rather than
  duplicates**.

- **🔢 Receipt numbers** — every entry is auto-stamped with a receipt number
  (`R-0001`, `R-0002`, …). KennelOS now has a matching **Receipt #** field, so at tax
  time you can relate a ledger line back to its photo here.

- **🏷 Businesses** — tag each entry with a business (configure the list in Settings).
  Use this app for more than the kennel and still **scope an export to just kennel
  expenses**. Business names are this app's own bucketing — they never go to KennelOS.

- **Categories** — the picker mirrors KennelOS's categories exactly; you can also add
  your **own custom categories** in Settings (KennelOS files anything it doesn't
  recognize under "Other", so custom ones suit non-kennel businesses).

- **🗓 Date-range filter** — the Export dialog has optional **From/To** dates that scope
  both the CSV and the PDF (and the live totals shown in the dialog update as you set
  them), so you can pull, say, one quarter's receipts.

- **🖼 Photos → PDF** — save the receipt photos as a PDF for your records: a **summary
  cover page** (count, date range, and **total** of the included receipts) followed by a
  tidy one-receipt-per-page document (image + number, date, amount, vendor/mileage,
  odometer, vehicle, driver, category, business, subject, notes). Available from the
  Export dialog (honoring the same business + date-range/scope filters) and per-receipt
  from the photo viewer. Uses the browser's own Print → Save as PDF — no library, fully
  offline.

**The photos stay here.** KennelOS stores no images by design, so this app is your
archive of the original receipt pictures; only the extracted numbers cross over.

- **💾 Backup / Restore** (Settings → Backup) — downloads a single `.zip` with every
  entry **and every photo's original bytes**, plus your settings (businesses,
  categories, vehicles, drivers). This is the only real data-loss protection for the
  photos — the CSV export carries numbers only, and Photos → PDF is a flattened,
  non-restorable printout. Save the file somewhere off this device (a cloud-synced
  folder, another computer); the download itself doesn't protect you if it never
  leaves the phone. Restore reads a `.zip` back in and upserts by id — safe to run on
  a fresh device or to re-run without duplicating anything. Settings shows how long
  it's been since your last backup next to the button.

## How the pieces fit

```
Receipts/
  index.html        the whole app (a list + capture/edit/export/settings modals)
  app.js            the controller (pages → repos, never db.* directly)
  sw.js             service worker (offline; app shell precached, OCR runtime-cached)
  manifest.json     PWA manifest
  data/
    db.js           Dexie schema — entries + photos tables
    entryRepo.js    CRUD for captured costs (receipts + trips)
    photoRepo.js    image storage (Blob + thumbnail) — the photo archive
    csvExport.js    builds the KennelOS-compatible CSV (columns match the importer)
    backup.js       full backup/restore — entries + photo bytes bundled as a .zip
    zip.js          minimal dependency-free ZIP reader/writer (store method only)
    ocr.js          offline receipt reading via vendored Tesseract.js
    vocab.js        categories/subjects — MIRRORS KennelOS's vocab (keep in sync)
    settings.js     default kennel name + mileage rate (localStorage)
  assets/ui.js      esc/format/modal/toast helpers
  vendor/           dexie + tesseract.js (all offline, no CDN)
```

### The export contract (keep in sync with KennelOS)

The CSV columns are exactly KennelOS's `expense` importer headers:

```
subject_type, subject_name, expense_date, amount, category, vendor, miles, mileage_rate, receipt_number, notes
```

`receipt_number` rides across (it's what ties the ledger row back to this app's entry
and photo). `business` does **not** — it only scopes which entries an export includes.

- A **receipt** row sets `amount` and `category`; `miles`/`mileage_rate` are blank.
- A **trip** row sets `miles` + `mileage_rate` and leaves `amount` blank — KennelOS
  derives it (miles × rate) and forces the category to `mileage`.
- `subject_type` is `kennel` (default — program overhead, matched by kennel name, or
  KennelOS's own configured kennel when the name is blank) or `dog` (matched by name).

If KennelOS renames or adds an expense category, mirror the change in
`data/vocab.js` here (an unknown category still imports — KennelOS soft-defaults it
to "Other" — but you lose the clean mapping).

## Run it

Static files, served over HTTP (never `file://`, which blocks ES module imports):

```bash
cd Receipts
python3 -m http.server 8000     # or: npx serve
# open http://localhost:8000/
```

On a phone, install it (Add to Home Screen) to use the camera and work offline. The
~7 MB OCR engine is fetched once on your first scan, then cached for offline use.

## Notes

- **No build, test runner, or linter** (same as KennelOS). Verify with
  `node --check <file>.js`, serving locally, and exercising the flow in a browser.
- **Service worker:** if you add/rename/remove a precached file, update
  `PRECACHE_URLS` and bump `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js` (the vendored OCR assets are
  deliberately runtime-cached, not precached, to keep install fast).
- OCR is **progressive enhancement** — if it can't load (old device, no wasm SIMD),
  the app still works fully with manual entry.
